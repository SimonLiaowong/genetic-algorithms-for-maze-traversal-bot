# Genetic Algorithms for Maze Traversal Bot
  Implemented genetic algorithm to populate and evolve a state-machine maze solver to traverse and solve different maze setups.
  
  Use a function GA(populationsize, numgenerate) in maze-traversal.py to generate maze-traversal-generated-rules. Then, enter text from maze-traversal-generated-rules to https://www.cs.hmc.edu/picobot/.
